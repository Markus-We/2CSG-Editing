Due to surprising results during the experiments, the naming of the different algorithms are a bit weird 
but kept this way to keep them consistent.

The algorithm called total_red as well as its results etc all include the rules that check if a vertex can only labeled one way. For 
the algorithm that actually only uses total sum of induced costs only_total_red... was used.
